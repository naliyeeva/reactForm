#React Registration Form

Project involves retrieval of user's personal data, after clicking 'Proceed' (if all input fields are filled out), asks for setting username and password (which should be minimum 8 characters long, at least with one letter and number). Finally, if everything is done correctly, user receives popup message 'Thank You!'
